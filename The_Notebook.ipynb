Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop Attachment The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & Primer BEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.

Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop Attachment The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & Primer BEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.

Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop Attachment The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans.

Suitable for Indoor or Outdoor Use.     Type: Metal Wall Art   Colors: Metallic  Materials: Upcycled Steel Metal   Finish: Painted   Dimensions: Approx. 24 Diameter  Care: If displaying outdoors it is recommended to spray with a clear lacquer once or twice a year, as prolonged exposure to the elements will cause rust.  Hanging Instructions: To hang metal art simply use pin head nails in the many nooks and spaces available in the design.

Lead Flashing (3 in. Vents)\",\"In many areas of the United States plumbing vents are sealed with lead. Unfortunately, squirrels like to gnaw on the lead and tear it open, potentially causing roof leaks. Over time, these leaks can cause significant damage.

In the past the only way to repair this was to call a contractor, have them pull shingles, replace the lead and put a screen on the repaired vent. A repair that requires shingle removal rarely looks good potentially exposes damage and is expensive. Critter Quitter offers a cost effective and attractive solution to this problem. A home owner can repair their damaged plumbing vents without having to remove shingles or call a professional. Simply cut the unit to match your roof pitch, slide the unit onto the damaged vent and secure with 4 stainless steel screws (provided). The internal component will direct rain water into the vent keeping the damaged portion dry and keep animals out of plumbing. The unit is easily removed if plumbing vent access is required.\"],[\"72 in. x 80 in.

Unlike \\\"point of use\\\" systems (like RO systems) that are installed to supply water to a specific faucet, the WGB32B-PB filters your water from the source. This means water from every output in your home will have passed through the three filtration stages of the WGB32B-PB. Used as the first stage of defense on the system, the stage 1 housing holds a 5-micron high-capacity polypropylene sediment filter. This filter removes dirt and other various larger sized particles from the water that can clog the following filters. The second stage of the WGB32B-PB houses a 5-micron CTO coconut shell carbon block filter. Block carbon is more effective than other forms of carbon in that it is finely ground up carbon packed into a solidified block. This means they have a higher density than other types of carbon filters and are therefore more effective in removing their targeted contaminants. The carbon block filter knocks out bad tastes and odors, removes over 90% of chlorine from the water and is highly effective on organic chemicals (VOCs) like pesticides, herbicides and industrial chemicals. The third stage of the WGB32B-PB houses an iron and lead reducing filter. The FCRC25B iron and lead reducing filter is only included with the WGB32B-PB, as it is not needed for most municipal water supplies that the WGB32B targets.\"],[\"1 gal. #S310-5 Brazilian Citrine Eggshell Enamel Interior Stain-Blocking Paint & Primer\",\"Introducing the best of BEHR Paint.

Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop Attachment The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & Primer BEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.

Lead Flashing (3 in. Vents)\",\"In many areas of the United States plumbing vents are sealed with lead.

Simply cut the unit to match your roof pitch, slide the unit onto the damaged vent and secure with 4 stainless steel screws (provided).

Unlike \\\"point of use\\\" systems (like RO systems) that are installed to supply water to a specific faucet, the WGB32B-PB filters your water from the source. This means water from every output in your home will have passed through the three filtration stages of the WGB32B-PB. Used as the first stage of defense on the system, the stage 1 housing holds a 5-micron high-capacity polypropylene sediment filter. This filter removes dirt and other various larger sized particles from the water that can clog the following filters. The second stage of the WGB32B-PB houses a 5-micron CTO coconut shell carbon block filter. Block carbon is more effective than other forms of carbon in that it is finely ground up carbon packed into a solidified block. This means they have a higher density than other types of carbon filters and are therefore more effective in removing their targeted contaminants. The carbon block filter knocks out bad tastes and odors, removes over 90% of chlorine from the water and is highly effective on organic chemicals (VOCs) like pesticides, herbicides and industrial chemicals. The third stage of the WGB32B-PB houses an iron and lead reducing filter.
